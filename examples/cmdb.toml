[scheduler]
# scheduler configuration

# scheduler::expression (string) is the CRON expression to be used by scheduler.
# Valid CRON expression format: <sec> <min> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week>
#
#   Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters
#   ------------ | ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------
#   Seconds      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
#   Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
#   Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -
#   Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?
#   Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -
#   Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?
#
# Specical characters:
# - Asterisk ( * )
#     The asterisk indicates that the cron expression will match for all values of the field;
#     e.g., using an asterisk in the 5th field (month) would indicate every month.
# - Slash ( / )
#     Slashes are used to describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the 1st field
#     (minutes) would indicate the 3rd minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. 
#     The form "*\/..." is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over
#     the largest possible range of the field. The form "N/..." is accepted as meaning 
#     "N-MAX/...", that is, starting at N, use the increment until the end of that specific 
#     range. It does not wrap around.
# - Comma ( , )
#     Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI" in the 5th
#     field (day of week) would mean Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
# - Hyphen ( - )
#     Hyphens are used to define ranges. For example, 9-17 would indicate every hour between 
#     9am and 5pm inclusive.
# - Question mark ( ? )
#     Question mark may be used instead of '*' for leaving either day-of-month or day-of-week blank.
#
# Shorthand descriptors:
# - @yearly (or @annually):
#     Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st, which is equivalent to:
#       0 0 0 1 1 *
# - @monthly:
#     Run once a month, midnight, first of month, which is equivalent to:
#       0 0 0 1 * *
# - @weekly:
#     Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun, which is equivalent to:
#       0 0 0 * * 0
# - @daily (or @midnight):
#     Run once a day, midnight, which is equivalent to:
#       0 0 0 * * *
# - @hourly:
#     Run once an hour, beginning of hour, which is equivalent to:
#       0 0 * * * *
# - @every <duration>:
#     User-specified interval. For example, "@every 1h30m10s" would indicate a schedule that 
#     activates after 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds, and then every interval after that.
#     Available time units are: "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", and "h".
